Results on synthetic datasets (SPGD-AA, CHEMMA, NMF and EDAA methods).

File name format:

``[method]_[dataset(noisy/noisefree/alpha=2/alpha=4)]_[endmembers/mixing_proportions].csv``

The results of `shifted` datasets are used to show how NMF fails by shifting the end-members and data.

We sorted the outputs of compared methods to match the order of EM1 to EM4. The raw outputs of compared methods end with ``_raw_output.csv``.
