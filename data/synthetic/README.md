# Files

``endmembers.csv``: values of 8 features (A to H) of 4 end-members (EM1 to EM4).

``mixing_proportions.csv``: mixing proportions of 4 end-members (EM1 to EM4) in 1000 samples, applied to both noise-free and noisy datasets. Mixing proportions are generated from a flat dirichlet distribution.

``noisefree_samples.csv``: values of 8 features (A to H) of 1000 samples, each of which is a strict mixtures of EM1 to EM4.

``noisy_endmembers.csv``: values of 8 features (A to H) of 1000 samples. In each of the dataset, we add a Gaussian noise (sigma=0.1) to each end-member, and mix these end-members up, then add a Gaussian noise (sigma=0.1) to the mixed samples.

# Additional Files

``alpha=2_samples.csv`` and ``alpha=2_mixing_proportions.csv`` are similar to the ``noisefree_samples.csv`` and ``mixing_proportions.csv`` files above. The only difference is the mixing proportions are generated with different alpha values for the dirichlet distribution. Same applies to files beginning with ``alpha=4``.

The ``shifted`` files are generated by shifting each feature of all end-members by +10. They are used to show NMF does not always work well.
